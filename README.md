# GrassField
 Animate a field of grass (C++/OpenGL)

This is a simple project to animate a collection of grass blades. The project still require further modifications to simulate a real grass field. However, it represents a good starting point.

To setup the project on your machine, please look up the Wiki of ModelViewer-OpenGL ([here](https://github.com/altherwy/ModelViewer-OpenGL/wiki/Setting-up-ModelViewer-on-Linux,-WSL,-and-macOS)). The steps are similar except for the last step where you just *make* the project without supplying parameters.
